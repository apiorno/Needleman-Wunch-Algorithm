# Needleman-Wunch-Algorithm
Needleman wunch algorithm implementation for Algorithms at UNQ

## Example

Inside **completed example** folder are the results of an execution of the **main.py** file but using de the notebook.

After installing dependencies, **main.py** can be run changing parameteres and also changing **x.fasta**. Or the notebook **TPFInal.ipynb** can be used for simplicity.

**src/x.fasta** is the one used by **main.py** and **/x.fasta** is the one used by **TPFInal.ipynb**
